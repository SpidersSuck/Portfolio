**Consistent Patterns**:
- All games in `src/games/[GameName].jsx`
- All use same prop structure: `{ onBack, onScoreUpdate }`
- All include restart button + keyboard shortcut
- All have ARIA labels
- All save scores the same way

**How I Used It**: Will create gameUtils.js before implementing new games.

## Summary: Week 8 Accomplishments

### Work Completed
- [x] Created comprehensive project README following template
- [x] Documented sprint progress (Sprints 1-2 complete, 3-6 planned)
- [x] Defined technical architecture with agent roles
- [x] Planned 3 additional games (Breakout, Simon Says, Minesweeper)
- [x] Identified bugs in existing games for Sprint 4

### Agent Coordination Pattern
**MCP Integration**: All three agents working from shared specifications
- ChatGPT provided overall planning and game specs
- DeepSeek received design system specs and created enhancement plan
- Gemini received game specs and created implementation roadmap
- Zero context loss: All agents aware of 6-game target and design system requirements

### Next Week Goals (Sprint 3)
